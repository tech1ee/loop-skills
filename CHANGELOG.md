# Changelog

## v0.7.0 — 2026-09-15

**Rewrite: one skill core, native distribution.**
- `loop-plan`, `loop-debug`, `loop-audit` are now single platform-neutral skills under `skills/`, shared by Claude Code, Codex, and Pi. Phase instructions load lazily from `phases/*.md`; the router is under 6K tokens.
- Convergence replaces phase counting: tier budgets (quick / standard / high-risk), evidence ledger, impact-closure checklist, "two rounds without a supported claim" stop rule, plan-review `current_high` contract with stall detection.
- Execution runs one fresh worker per task with per-task checkpoints; re-invoking the same slug resumes from the first unfinished task.
- Distribution is native: `.claude-plugin/` and `.agents/plugins/` marketplaces point at the repository root; install with `claude plugin marketplace add tech1ee/loop-skills` or `codex plugin marketplace add tech1ee/loop-skills`. Updates come from `claude plugin update` / Claude's startup check and `codex plugin marketplace upgrade`.
- The Claude Code test-file lock hook now ships in the plugin (`hooks/test-lock.py`).
- `npx loop-skills` is a platform picker that runs the native commands and offers to remove 0.6 copy-installs. `update`, `list`, `verify`, `uninstall`, `codex`, `init` subcommands are gone.
- Removed: `skills/pi/`, `plugins/`, `commands/`, `templates/`, the Codex review wrappers (`run-codex-review.sh`, `codex-plan-review.sh`, `should-run-codex.py`, `second-opinion` agent) which depended on files outside the package, and all personal-vault and ADR-number requirements from skills and agents.
- 30 stack-specific auditor agents moved to `agents/optional/`; the plugin auto-loads the 10 agents the loops dispatch.
- Skill invocation on Claude Code is namespaced: `/loop-skills:loop-plan`.

**Migration from 0.6:** run `npx loop-skills` (or delete `~/.claude/skills/loop-plan`, `~/.claude/skills/loop-debug` and the copied agents) so the old copies do not shadow the plugin; on Codex run `codex plugin remove loop-skills@personal` before adding the marketplace.

## v0.6.0 — 2026-07-16

**Codex-native distribution:**
- Added a validated Codex plugin with native `loop-plan`, `loop-debug`, and `loop-audit` skills.
- Added `npx loop-skills codex` / `install-codex` to stage the plugin in the personal marketplace and enable it through the Codex CLI.
- Made every supported Codex workflow selectable during interactive or scripted installation, with safe dependency inclusion for `loop-debug`.
- Adapted the workflows to Codex plans, bounded subagents, current web research, skills and MCP connectors, sandbox approvals, and outcome-level verification.
- Added isolated installer, marketplace-preservation, stale-upgrade cleanup, package-boundary, and real Codex CLI installation coverage.

## v0.5.4 — 2026-07-15

**Scope correction:**
- Moved the model/subscription limits panel out of the loop-skills package and into the local Pi setup.
- Loop-skills remains focused on planning, debugging, evidence, inventory, and progress orchestration.

## v0.5.3 — 2026-07-15

**Limits visualization:**
- Added a below-editor `loop-limits` widget with model context-window bars, session token/request/cost usage, provider billing mode, and optional configured windows.
- Added `/loop-limits` refresh command.
- Remote ChatGPT subscription quotas are explicitly shown as unavailable when Pi does not expose provider quota data; no fake percentages are generated.

## v0.5.2 — 2026-07-15

**Publish metadata fix:**
- Normalized npm `bin` and repository metadata for the unscoped `loop-skills` package.

## v0.5.1 — 2026-07-15

**Public package correction:**
- Published under the unscoped public npm name `loop-skills` because the `@loopskills` scope did not permit creating the renamed package with the release token.
- Updated installer updates, docs, badges, E2E tests, and metadata to use `loop-skills`.

## v0.5.0 — 2026-07-15

**Brand and package rename:**
- Renamed the primary package to `loop-skills`.
- Renamed the primary CLI to `loop-skills`; `claude-skills` remains an installation alias for compatibility.
- Renamed the GitHub repository to `tech1ee/loop-skills`.
- Updated public documentation, agent install examples, badges, repository links, release tests, and metadata.
- Existing `@loopskills/claude-skills` installs remain available and are not removed.

## v0.4.5 — 2026-07-15

**Adaptive orchestration and capability discovery:**
- Added the adaptive-loop protocol: triage tiers, explicit budgets, evidence ledger, information-gain probe selection, diminishing-return stopping, and residual-risk reporting.
- Added `loop_inventory` to discover active tools, skills, agents, extensions, packages, models, and MCP configuration without exposing secrets or prompt bodies.
- Added `loop_evidence` for atomic, source-backed claim tracking in `.pi/plans/*.state.json`.
- Added capability-aware routing guidance for scouts, context builders, researchers, reviewers, workers, oracles, and user/project agents.
- Added extension type-checking to the test pipeline and synchronized Pi peer dependencies.

## v0.4.4 — 2026-07-15

**Release fix:**
- Synced `package-lock.json` with Pi peer dependencies so clean CI/npm installs work reliably.

## v0.4.3 — 2026-07-14

**Pi progress UI:**
- Added the `loop_progress` tool and bundled Pi extension.
- Displays a persistent checkpoint list above the editor with completed/running/blocked states, current-step progress bars, and short live descriptions.
- Added `/loop-progress` and `/loop-progress clear` commands.
- Loop-plan and loop-debug now update the panel at phase boundaries and during delegated investigation, review, and verification.
- Added extension packaging, checksum, safety, and discovery coverage.

## v0.4.2 — 2026-07-14

**Proactive investigation improvements:**
- Loop planning now requires autonomous impact-closure: follow-up exploration maps callers, consumers, boundaries, similar cases, edge cases, and residual unknowns before asking product questions.
- Loop debugging now performs causal-graph closure instead of stopping at the first plausible stack frame.
- Added explicit test-quality audits covering oracle independence, mock realism, boundary coverage, tautological tests, missing negative cases, and prevention tests.
- Similar-case search and adjacent-entry-point disposition are now required before a debug fix is considered verified.

## v0.4.1 — 2026-07-14

**Release fix:**
- Fixed the Pi package test to run on Node 18, the minimum supported Node version.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-07-14

**Pi support:**
- Added a first-class Pi package manifest (`package.json` → `pi.skills`).
- Added Pi-native `loop-plan`, `loop-debug`, and `loop-audit` skills.
- Pi workflows use native `subagent` orchestration, OpenAI-compatible model selection, `.pi/plans/` artifacts, explicit approval gates, and one-writer safety.
- Added package-discovery and portability tests for Pi.
- Preserved the existing Claude Code installer and skill payload unchanged except for an AskUserQuestion gate contradiction fix.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-05-23

**New agents (2):**
- `loop-verifier` — goal-backward adversarial achievement verifier. Runs a 4-level artifact check (exists → substantive → wired → data-flows) + behavioral probes against a `must_haves` contract. Returns a tri-state verdict (`passed | gaps_found | human_needed`). The execution probes are the hard gate — task-completion narration is never accepted as evidence. Used at every stage boundary in `loop-plan` and at terminal acceptance in `loop-debug`.
- `test-writer` — separate TDD test author (separation-of-duties anti-cheating control). Authors failing tests from a task's `Test behaviors:` spec, proves them RED, and returns file paths for hash-locking before any implementer runs. Refuses to touch production code. Embodies 7 anti-gaming prohibitions (no tautological oracles, no signature-only assertions, no implementation coupling).

**Skill updates — `loop-plan`:**
- Phase 2 HARD GATE: cannot advance if `must_haves.truths[]` is empty, contains "TBD", "better", "improve", or any non-observable predicate
- Phase 7b pre-dispatch anti-cheating: `test-writer` dispatch → hash-lock → `guard-mutation` oracle; post-dispatch: `detect-test-gaming` (D1) + `detect-tautological-tests` (D2) HARD-BLOCKs; per-task Codex cross-vendor review; non-skippable mutation floor
- Stage boundary gates: `loop-verifier` dispatched at each stage; `gaps_found` halts the DAG and generates fix tasks
- Completion gate: `completion_state = "shipped"` ONLY after `loop-verifier` verdict `passed` (or signed-off `human_needed`). Never set on task-count completion alone.

**Skill updates — `loop-debug`:**
- Phase 2 HARD GATE: acceptance criteria lifted into `must_haves` contract before advancing to Phase 3
- Per-task cross-vendor validation on T0a, T-fix, and T0b (Codex `stage:diff`, cost-gated)
- `spec-reviewer` is also handed `must_haves.truths` — verifies the fix satisfies acceptance criteria, not only that T0a is GREEN
- Terminal acceptance check: `loop-verifier` dispatched after T0a GREEN + mutation post≥pre; `gaps_found` → HALT + gap-closure tasks

**Reference files updated:**
- `references/state-schema.md` — `goal`, `must_haves`, `verification`, `stages[]` fields added with HARD GATE rule
- `references/drift-check.md` — Rule 0 (goal coverage: every `must_haves.truth` → ≥1 task) and Rule 0b (cross-vendor per task: every non-opt-out task needs `Cross-vendor validation:` line) now apply at **all** rigor tiers
- `references/tdd-workflow.md` — anti-cheating guardrails section (P1 separation of duties, V2 guard-mutation, D1/D2 detectors, V1 non-skippable mutation floor) + PBT recipe (function-shape → invariant table, Hypothesis template)
- `references/implementer-prompt-addendum.md` — P5 anti-gaming prohibition list (7 rules: no test edits, no hardcoded returns, no `__eq__` overrides, no stack inspection, no sentinel printing, no mining git history, no SUT-as-oracle)

**New bin scripts (2):**
- `bin/detect-test-gaming.py` — static detector for implementer-side gaming patterns (hardcoded returns for test inputs, branching on fixture values, stack inspection, sentinel printing). Exit 1 = HARD-BLOCK.
- `bin/detect-tautological-tests.py` — static detector for tautological test oracles (expected = sut(input) patterns, zero-assertion tests, trivially-always-true assertions). Exit 1 = HARD-BLOCK.

**Bin script updates (2):**
- `bin/should-run-codex.py` — security-class regex broadened (covers `defender`, `injection`, `homoglyph`, `sanitiz`, `redact`, `entitlement`); `_parse_numstat` handles binary files and rename paths correctly
- `bin/test-integrity.py` — `guard-mutation` subcommand added: source-level mutation testing oracle that proves tests are non-tautological by verifying at least one mutant (constant-fold, return-None, comparison-flip, string-literal) causes a test failure

## v0.2.2 — 2026-05-20

**Agent updates (23 agents):**
- `adr-completeness-auditor`, `char-test-coverage-auditor`, `comment-quality-auditor`, `complexity-long-method-auditor`, `dip-dependency-direction-auditor`, `dry-duplication-auditor`, `naming-conventions-auditor`, `research-agent`, `security-reviewer`, `srp-godclass-auditor`, `yagni-premature-abstraction-auditor` — updated to latest versions

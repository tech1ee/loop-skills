# Supporting Agents
> **0.7.0:** the plugin auto-loads the 10 universal and explorer agents. Stack-specific auditors live in `agents/optional/`; copy any you want into `~/.claude/agents/` or your project's `.claude/agents/`.


Loop skills come with an optional set of agents that the orchestration pipeline uses at runtime. These are separate from the skills themselves — you can install all of them, some, or none.

## What agents are

In Claude Code, agents are Markdown files in `~/.claude/agents/`. When loop-plan dispatches a task to an agent, Claude Code loads the agent's Markdown as a system prompt and runs it with its own context and tool access.

Loop-plan uses agents in several places:
- **the explore phase** — read-only explorer agents map the codebase in parallel
- **the research phase** — research-agent runs 5-step methodology research per domain
- **the execute phase** — implementation pipeline: test-writer authors tests → spec-reviewer and code-quality-reviewer gate each task → loop-verifier verifies goal achievement at stage boundaries
- **On-demand** — auditor agents triggered by specific code changes (Android audit, iOS preflight, quality detectors, etc.)

Agents are organized into 8 groups in the installer. Install the groups that match your stack.

## Agent reference

### Universal agents

### `loop-verifier`

**Role:** Goal-backward, adversarial achievement verifier. Verifies that a stage (or the whole plan) *achieved its goal*, not merely that its tasks were marked done.

**Used in:** Every stage boundary in loop-plan (the execute phase); terminal acceptance in loop-debug (Phase 6). `completion_state = "shipped"` is blocked until this agent returns `passed`.

**Returns:** Tri-state verdict — `passed | gaps_found | human_needed` — plus a scored artifact-check table and probe results.

**How it works:**

The verifier starts from an adversarial stance: *assume the goal was NOT achieved until codebase evidence proves otherwise.* It never reads an executor's summary first.

1. **4-level artifact check** per required artifact:
   - L1 exists — `ls`/`find`
   - L2 substantive — not a stub (no `TODO`, `return None`, `return []`, `pass` that flows to output)
   - L3 wired — actually imported and called, registered in the right config/settings
   - L4 data-flows — real data reaches it (not a hardcoded `return json([])`)
2. **Behavioral probes** — 2–4 spot-checks that exercise the stated acceptance criteria. Each runs in ≤10s with no side effects. A FAILED probe overrides any artifact check.

The `must_haves` contract (truths, artifacts, key_links) is derived from your goal in Phase 2 and verified without access to the implementation summary.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The execution probes are the hard gate. A file can exist. A function can be imported. Tests can pass. None of that is sufficient — the verifier must observe the behavior you asked for.

---

### `test-writer`

**Role:** Separate TDD test author. Exists so that the agent which writes the tests is never the agent which makes them pass — the single most effective anti-cheating control in AI-assisted TDD.

**Used in:** the execute phase (loop-plan) — dispatched before the implementer. Returns file paths for hash-locking. The implementer that runs next cannot modify the locked test files.

**Returns:** Test file paths, test method names, RED proof (runner output showing new tests FAIL for the right reason), and confirmation that no source/production file was touched.

**Hard boundaries:**
- Writes to TEST files only (`test_*.py`, `*Test.kt`, `*Spec.swift`, `*.test.ts`, etc.)
- Refuses to create, edit, or open any production/source/config file — replies `BLOCKED — out of scope for test-writer: this is implementation work`
- Never computes expected values by calling the SUT (that's a tautological oracle)

**Anti-gaming prohibitions embedded in every test it writes:**
1. Public interface only — assert return values, stdout, exit codes; never call counts or internal structure
2. No tautologies — expected values are computed by hand and hard-coded
3. No zero-variance tests — every test has at least one assertion that can fail
4. Determinism — no wall-clock, network, or real working-tree state; inject time/paths
5. No weakening — if a behavior in the spec seems impossible, reports `CANNOT_SATISFY` and stops
6. Behavior, not signature — a test that only checks a function exists is not a test
7. Cover the corners explicitly — error paths, fail-open/fail-safe defaults, boundary values

---

### `spec-reviewer`

**Role:** Verifies that an implementation matches the plan spec.

**Used in:** the execute phase — runs after each implementer task completes.

**Returns:** `SPEC-COMPLIANT` or `NOT-SPEC-COMPLIANT: <reasons>` with specific line references.

**What it checks:**
- Does the implementation match the task's stated goal?
- Are all files listed in "Files to change" actually changed?
- Are the test assertions from the spec present and non-trivial?
- Was anything added that the spec didn't ask for?

> [!NOTE]
> spec-reviewer is intentionally strict. It only checks whether the spec was followed — not whether the code is good. That's code-quality-reviewer's job. Separation of concerns means neither reviewer second-guesses the other.

---

### `code-quality-reviewer`

**Role:** 11-dimension code quality check.

**Used in:** the execute phase — runs after spec-reviewer passes.

**Returns:** `QUALITY-PASS` or `NEEDS-REWORK: <findings>` with dimension labels.

**The 11 dimensions:**
1. Naming — identifiers are self-describing, no abbreviations
2. Single responsibility — each function does one thing
3. DRY — no unnecessary duplication (Rule of Three gate)
4. YAGNI — no speculative abstractions
5. Error handling — failures are explicit, not swallowed
6. Test quality — assertions test behavior, not implementation details
7. Dependency direction — no upward or circular imports
8. Interface design — APIs are minimal and hard to misuse
9. Comments — WHY only, not WHAT
10. Complexity — no function over cyclomatic complexity 10
11. Mutability — minimal shared mutable state

> [!NOTE]
> At `rigor: minimal`, code-quality-reviewer is skipped. At `rigor: standard tier`, it runs but dimensions 1–5 are advisory (not blocking). At `rigor: full`, all 11 dimensions are gating.

---

### `research-agent`

**Role:** 5-step methodology research with date verification and cross-validation.

**Used in:** the research phase — dispatched for each research domain in parallel.

**Returns:** Structured findings with source URLs, dates, and confidence scores (HIGH/MED/LOW).

**5-step methodology:**
1. Decompose the query into ≥5 sub-questions
2. Search ≥15 sources (official docs via context7, blogs, issues, benchmarks)
3. Score source credibility (authority, currency, objectivity)
4. Synthesize across sources — flag conflicts, identify consensus (3+ sources = HIGH)
5. Return findings with full citation trail

> [!NOTE]
> research-agent applies a date filter: for fast-moving APIs and frameworks, results older than 60 days are flagged. Claude's training data is not used as a substitute for current docs.

---

### `test-runner`

**Role:** Runs the project's test suite and reports pass/fail with failing test names.

**Used in:** the execute phase — runs between implementer and spec-reviewer.

**Returns:** `PASS: N/N` or `FAIL: N/M — [list of failing tests]`

**Auto-detects:** Gradle/Kotlin, `xcodebuild` (iOS), `npm test`, `pytest`, `swift test`.

For mutation testing (Standard/Hardened intensity in loop-debug), test-runner also runs the mutation engine and reports: `mutation score: X% → Y%` (post must be ≥ pre).

---


### `security-reviewer`

**Role:** Audits just-written code for auth bypass, injection, exposed secrets, and insecure data handling.

**Used in:** After any auth/payment/secrets/data-handling code change (background, advisory).

**Returns:** Findings with >80% confidence only, severity HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW.

**What it checks:** OWASP Top 10, auth bypass patterns, SQL/command injection, hardcoded secrets, insecure deserialization, unsafe redirects.

---

### `srp-godclass-auditor`

**Role:** Detects Single Responsibility Principle violations and God-class smells with quantitative metrics.

**Used in:** After non-trivial class additions or before merge.

**Returns:** LCOM4 score, WMC+ATFD+TCC, LOC, field/method count per flagged class with remediation recommendations.

**Threshold:** Classes with LCOM4 > 1 AND LOC > 200 are flagged as God-class candidates.

---

### `dry-duplication-auditor`

**Role:** Detects code duplication with a Rule-of-Three gate — two copies is fine, three is a required extraction.

**Used in:** After multi-file changes or before merge.

**Returns:** Duplicate blocks with file:line references, copy count, and `LEAVE` (count < 3) or `EXTRACT` (count ≥ 3) verdict.

## Install specific agents

The interactive installer lets you pick by group. To install specific agents non-interactively, use `--agents`:

```bash
# Install loop-plan + only the the execute phase review gates
claude-skills --skills loop-plan --agents spec-reviewer,code-quality-reviewer,test-runner --no-bin

# Android project: the explore phase explorer + Android audit agents
claude-skills --skills loop-plan,loop-debug \
  --agents android-kmp-explorer,android-coroutine-scope-leak-auditor,android-fgs-compliance-auditor,android-r8-proguard-auditor

# iOS project: the explore phase explorer + iOS/macOS auditors
claude-skills --skills loop-plan,loop-debug \
  --agents swiftui-explorer,ios-appstore-preflight-auditor,kmp-swift-interop-readiness-auditor

# Full stack (TypeScript + quality gates)
claude-skills --skills loop-plan,loop-debug \
  --agents react-nextjs-explorer,typescript-strict-mode-auditor,spec-reviewer,code-quality-reviewer,security-reviewer
```

---

## Agents loop-plan doesn't install

These agents are part of Claude Code's built-in catalog and don't need to be installed separately:

- `Explore` — generic read-only codebase explorer (used for non-Android/iOS/React stacks)
- `Plan` — used for architecture design phases

If you're on Android, iOS, or React/Next.js, install the matching stack explorer for better the explore phase results than the generic `Explore` agent.
